A Netflix clone I built as a bootcamp student at [Tealeaf Academy](https://gotealeaf.com) (which has rebranded as [Launch School](https://launchschool.com/))

Built with Ruby 2 and Rails 4. Tested with RSpec.

### Features
- User Accounts
- Users can follow other Users
- Users can add videos to a queue, and organize them how they see fit
- Video ratings and Reviews
- Admin Panel: view user payments and add new videos
- Advanced video searching with Elasticsearch

I plan on revisiting this project during the summer of 2018 and updating it to Rails 5 using React on the Front End.
